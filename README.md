# Simple-ATM-System
Explore a simplified Java ATM program for deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and transaction records. Secure user authentication with PIN. Run the simulation to learn object-oriented programming concepts and contribute to its improvement.

This GitHub repository showcases a concise Java implementation of a basic Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system. The system encompasses essential elements, such as user accounts, transactions, user authentication, and ATM interactions. Users can engage in fundamental banking operations like depositing funds, withdrawing cash, transferring money, and reviewing transaction history.

## Features

- **Account Management**: The `Account` class facilitates financial activities like deposits, withdrawals, and transfers, while also maintaining transaction records.
- **Transaction Tracking**: The `Transaction` class keeps track of transaction details, including type, amount, and timestamp.
- **User Authentication**: The `User` class ensures secure user access by authenticating using a PIN.
- **ATM Interaction**: The `ATM` class orchestrates the interaction between users and the ATM, offering options for various transactions.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the Java classes.
3. Run the `Main` class to initiate the ATM simulation.
4. Authenticate using the provided PIN.
5. Choose from the menu options: Deposit, Withdraw, Transfer, Transaction History, or Quit.

## Components

- **Account**: Manages financial actions (deposit, withdrawal, transfer) and tracks transaction history.
- **Transaction**: Represents individual transactions with details like type, amount, and timestamp.
- **User**: Ensures user security through PIN-based authentication and links to an associated account.
- **ATM**: Handles user interaction and transaction execution within the simulation.
